# soda_shack_landing_page

<h2>This is One Day Build Project</h2>
My Brother wants to open a Soda Shack in Tenesse, he asked me to build a landing page that he could put out to gauge interest in the Idea of a Soda Shop in one of the college towns he lives nearby. I ran with the idea and built this very simple landing page in one day using Flask, SQLAlchemy, css, java script, Python.

- The customer gets directed to this page by clicking on a link or ad.
- They fill out the form, hit subscribe.
- Their info is stored in a database.
- Then that same info is sent to a business email to get real time updates on interest in the soda shop.


The live site is found at:
 - https://sodashack.herokuapp.com/
